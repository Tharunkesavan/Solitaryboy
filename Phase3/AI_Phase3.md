# Fake News Detection Model

This project demonstrates the development of a simple fake news detection model using Python. The model uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and the scikit-learn library for machine learning. It's designed to classify news articles as either fake (label 1) or real (label 0) based on their content.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- nltk (for text preprocessing)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn
```

Additionally, you might need to download NLTK datasets by running the following code in a Python environment:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Usage

1. **Dataset**

   Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided and place the CSV files ("Fake.csv" and "True.csv") in the appropriate directory.

2. **Running the Code**

   Run the provided Python code in a Python environment. Make sure to replace the file paths in the `pd.read_csv` statements with the actual paths to your dataset.

3. **Model Training**

   The code loads the fake and real news datasets, preprocesses the textual data by removing stopwords, and applies either Count Vectorization or TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features. The model uses a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, but you can experiment with other classifiers based on your requirements.

4. **Evaluation**

   The model's performance is evaluated by calculating accuracy and generating a classification report.

5. **Results**

   The accuracy of the fake news detection model is printed to the console, along with a detailed classification report.

## Customization

You can customize this code to suit your specific project needs. Some possible customizations include:

- Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine).
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Adding additional text preprocessing steps or using more advanced natural language processing techniques.
- Visualizing the results using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
